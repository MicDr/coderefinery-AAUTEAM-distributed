Components
spaghetti squash
tomato sauce
fresh basil
grated Grana Padano cheese
spicy giardiniera (if you're into that kind of thing. I eat on almost anything)

Preparation
Bake the spaghetti squash and scoop it into strands. While the squash is baking, prepare the tomato sauce. Toss the squash with the sauce and spoon onto tortillas, or more authentically, taco shells. Use scissors to snip thin strips of fresh basil on top of the tacos and sprinkle withe the cheese.

The squash can be pretty moist, so if you're using corn tortillas, you'll want to double-up.
